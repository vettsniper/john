    <h2>My Experience</h2>
    <p>During the TCGC LMC, I had an unforgettable experience. The opening salvo was exciting, with students happily participating, and the fireworks added a magical touch. I also enjoyed cheering on my friends in the Ms. and Mr. TCGC contest, feeling proud of their efforts. The event was well-planned and executed, making it truly enjoyable. It was one of the happiest moments of my life, and Iâ€™ll always cherish the memories.</p>
